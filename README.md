# Lindquist-Neil-Work
Personal repository for Neil Lindquist research efforts.

This repository contains files from two projects: the implementation of JuliaPetra, and using compression to improve sparse, iterative linear solvers.
Note that the `hpcg-master` branch contains the original hpcg work before it was split off into the HPCG-ZFP repository.
The `master` branch contains the latest Julia work, except for JuliaPetra itself and the power-method implementation that loads the matrix from file (which is located in the `matrix-market-power-method` branch).

## Descriptions of folders
`bibliography` - a collection of references for the hpcg project
`hpcg` - a copy of the HPCG benchmark for experimenting with mixed precision
`hpcg-compression notes` - various notes from the hpcg project
`julia` - the directory for the JuliaPetra project
`MatLab` - MatLab code used in the initial stages of the hpcg project
`Thesis` - my undergraduate thesis about the hpcg project
