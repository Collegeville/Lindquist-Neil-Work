 annote={Single precision floats are able to be processed faster and the communication is much cheaper that working with double precision floats.  The authors mixed single and double precision in each refinment step.  They found that if factorization, forward substitution and backward substitution are do in single precision while the residual and update to the solution are done in double precision then the iterative refinement will produce the same accuracy than if double precision was used exclusively (as long as the matrix is "not too badly conditioned").}
