These results are obtained from the power-method implementation that reads the matrix from a matrix market format file (see the `matrix-market-power-method` branch).
The result files are all of the form `results-[matrix id].final.txt` and contain the output of running `./Run\ power-method\ time\ tests.sh 20` five times.
The matrices are all obtained from the [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection](https://sparse.tamu.edu).
