# Questions from Q&A
 * Did the functional nature of Julia help with performance?
 * How portable is Julia? GPU support? Different CPU hardware?
 * Won't losing compile time checking increase the number of bugs?
 * What's the array base? Are multidimentional arrays supported?
 * How does it compare to Epetra with regard to lines of code?
 * How is the interopability with C and C++?
May have been one or two more that I forgot

# Other notes
 * The text could have been a bit smaller
 * The presentation itself took about 12-15 minutes, with Q&A bringing it to roughly 20 minutes
