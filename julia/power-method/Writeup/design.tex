\title{Implementing the Power Method using Julia Petra}
\author{Neil Lindquist}

\begin{document}
	
The Julia implementation of the power method is a little more easily readable, in my opinion, but it's not
a huge difference in readability.
A few of the expressions that are cleaner in Julia include, using the broadcast operator instead of
method calls for vector operators like scale and add, and returning the result, instead of using a output parameter.

My experience on implementing the power method is probably of limited value, given that I was transcribing the ePetra
implementation.
