\title{Implementing the Power Method using Julia Petra}
\author{Neil Lindquist}

\begin{document}
	
Neither the C implementation nor the Julia implementation of the power method it's self are significantly easier to read.
Julia has a few expressions that are cleaner, such as a using the broadcast operator instead of
operators as method calls and returning the result, instead of using a output parameter.

My experience on implementing the power method is probably of limited value, given that I was transcribing the ePetra
implementation.
